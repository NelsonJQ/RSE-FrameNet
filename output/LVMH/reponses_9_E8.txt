Explication:

According to the Herm√®s Group's report, the company invests in research and development (R&D) for products/services respectful of the environment. However, the report does not provide a specific percentage of the revenue invested in R&D for eco-friendly products/services. Instead, it focuses on the overall investments made by the company.
