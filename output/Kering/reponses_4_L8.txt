Explication:

According to the Kering Group's report, the mean ratio between the base salary and total remuneration for women and men (comparing jobs of equal value) during the reporting period is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that Kering aims to ensure a decent standard of living for each employee and their family by providing fair compensation packages.
