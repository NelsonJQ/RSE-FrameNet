 To provide the answer in the requested format, I will first calculate the total amount of pollutants generated by each type of action and then sum them up to get the total amount of pollutants for all actions.

Here's a breakdown of the pollutant emissions for each type of action:

1. Actions with performance conditions satisfied: 
* NOx: (5,422 + 30,072) x 0.001 = 35.492 tons
* SOx: (163,134 + 184,291) x 0.0001 = 34.742 tons
* COV: (177,034 + 40,000 + 188,965 + 146,844) x 0.001 = 412.843 tons
* PAD: Not specified for actions with performance conditions satisfied.
* PM10: (5,422 + 163,134 + 3,919) x 0.0001 = 19.735 tons
* POP: Not specified for actions with performance conditions satisfied.
1. Actions with attributions becoming definite or provisional:
* NOx: (40,000 + 44,225) x 0.001 = 84.225 tons
* SOx: Not specified for actions with attributions becoming definite or provisional.
* COV: (40,000 + 40,000 + 3,325) x 0.001 = 83.325 tons
* PAD: Not specified for actions with attributions becoming definite or provisional.
* PM10: (40,000 + 44,225 + 3,325) x 0.0001 = 47.547 tons
* POP: Not specified for actions with attributions becoming definite or provisional.
1. Actions without specific pollutant emissions:
* NOx: (10,790 + 1,308 + 25,000 + 11,032 + 1,682 + 1,359 + 1,000 + 13,752 + 15,000 + 35,000 + 140,895) x 0.001 = 379.198 tons
* SOx: Not specified for actions without specific pollutant emissions.
* COV: (2,679 + 146,844 + 139,592 + 136,227) x 0.001 = 289.362 tons
* PAD: Not specified for actions without specific pollutant emissions.
* PM10: (2,679 + 146,844 + 139,592 + 136,227) x 0.0001 = 28.626 tons
* POP: Not specified for actions without specific pollutant emissions.

Now, summing up the total pollutants for each type:

NOx: 35.492 + 84.225 + 379.198 = 508.915 tons (rounded to three decimal places)
SOx: 34.742 tons
COV: 412.843 + 83.325 + 289.362 = 785.530 tons (rounded to three decimal places)
PAD: Not specified for actions without specific pollutant emissions
PM10: 19.735 + 47.547 + 28.626 = 95.908 tons (rounded to three decimal places)
POP: Not specified for actions without specific pollutant emissions

The answer is:
[('tonsNOx': 508.915, 'unit': "tons"), ('tonsSOx': 34.742, 'unit': "tons"), ('tonsCOV': 785.530, 'unit': "tons"), ('tonsPM10': 95.908, 'unit': "tons"), ('tonsPOP': 0, 'unit': "tons")]

Note: The total amount of POP (Persistent Organic Pollutants) is not specified for any actions in the provided table; therefore, its value is 0 tons.
