 Based on the information provided, there is no specific data about the company's land holdings or operations near biodiversity hotspots or protected areas. However, we can infer that the company has some involvement in such areas based on the knowledge that terres à vignes (wine-growing lands) make up the majority of the value in the "Terres à vignes et vignobles" category.

To provide an answer, we would need to estimate the amount of land near biodiversity hotspots based on available information. For example, if we knew that all of the company's terres à vignes were located in a region with several biodiversity hotspots, we might estimate that a significant portion of their land was located near these areas.

However, without more precise data about the location and extent of the company's land holdings, any estimation would be speculative at best. Therefore, I would recommend further research or consultation with the company to obtain more specific information about their operations in relation to biodiversity hotspots and protected areas.
