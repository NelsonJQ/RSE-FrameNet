Answer_Justification:  Based on the provided principles of organization, LVMH SE, the parent company, has a coordinating and driving role in risk management and internal control across the Group. The President of a House is responsible for the risk management and internal control of all the subsidiaries contributing to the brand's global activity. This shows that there is a formal structure in place for risk and control management at the highest level of the organization, with clear roles and responsibilities defined for different actors. Therefore, it can be inferred that LVMH has a "riskAndControlCommittee" with a significant influence over the company's risk management and internal control practices.
