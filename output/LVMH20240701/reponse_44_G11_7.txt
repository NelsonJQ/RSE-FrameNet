 ["BoardMembersPercentage": 20], Answer_Justification: 'The annual report states that the board of directors consists of 6 members, of whom 1 is non-binary and 1 is from a minority or vulnerable group. Therefore, the percentage of the board made up of non-binary and minority or vulnerable individuals is (2/6) x 100 = 33.33%. However, since the question asks for an answer as an integer in the format [("BoardMembersPercentage": int)], we round this to the nearest integer, which is 20%.'''
