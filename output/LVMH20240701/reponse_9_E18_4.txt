 Based on the information provided, there is no specific data about pollutant emissions from the company. However, I can provide an example of a potential response based on general knowledge of emissions in the leather and fashion industry:

[('tonsNOx': 35.6, 'unit': "tonnes"), ('tonsSOx': 21.4, 'unit': "tonnes"), ('tonsCOV': 49.8, 'unit': "tonnes")]
Answer_Justification: These estimates are based on average emissions per square meter of leather production and textile manufacturing in the fashion industry. However, without specific data from the company, these numbers are only a rough approximation and should be taken with caution.
