 Based on the information provided in the table on Page 114, I cannot directly calculate the amount of pollutants produced by the activities listed since there is no specific data about pollutant emissions. However, based on the categorization of taxonomy-aligned activities, we can infer that the following activities may contribute to certain pollutants:

1. Rénovation de bâtiment existant (Existing building renovation)
2. Installation, maintenance et réparation d'équipements favorisant l'efficacité énergétique (Installation, maintenance and repair of energy-efficient equipment)
3. Installation, maintenance et réparation d'instruments et de dispositifs de mesure, de régulation et de contrôle de la performance énergétique des bâtiments (Installation, maintenance and repair of energy performance measurement, regulation, and control instruments in buildings)
4. Installation, maintenance et réparation de technologies liées aux énergies renouvelables (Installation, maintenance, and repair of renewable energy technologies)
5. Acquisition et propriété de bâtiments (Building acquisition and ownership)

These activities are related to construction, renovation, and energy efficiency improvements, which may involve the use of materials, equipment, and transportation that contribute to some pollutants such as oxydes d'azote (NOx), oxydes de souffre (SOx), composés organiques volatils (COV), et particules en suspension (PM10). However, without specific information on the emissions from these activities, I cannot provide an exact quantification of pollutants in the required format.

Answer: Not available in the requested format due to insufficient data.

Answer Justification: The table provided does not contain specific information on pollutant emissions generated by the taxonomy-aligned activities.
