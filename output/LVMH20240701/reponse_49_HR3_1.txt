Answer Justification: The LVMH Group's Walk the Talk event and the publication of the LGBTI+ activities report demonstrate a clear commitment to addressing discrimination against LGBTI+ individuals within the company. By shedding light on the concrete actions taken by the Group, its Houses, and regions to promote inclusivity and combat such discrimination, LVMH has shown an effort to better understand the risks and impacts faced by LGBTI+ employees and stakeholders. The event also featured discussions about potential means of preventing or mitigating these issues and highlighted collaborative efforts through supporting employee participation in Pride marches worldwide. However, there is no explicit mention of evaluating progress made in prevention or attenuation or collaborating with external organizations or representatives to address these concerns on a broader scale.
