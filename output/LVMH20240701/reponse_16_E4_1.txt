 Based on the provided extract, here is my assessment of the company's evaluation and prevention of environmental impacts:

[("preventionImpact": "Examiner les probl√®mes sur une base ad hoc")], Answer\_Justification : The document does not provide sufficient information to determine if the company has set any targets or objectives related to environmental impact, either through internal initiatives or external programs. There is no mention of any key performance indicators (KPIs) related to environmental sustainability, and the only relevant information provided is related to risks associated with climate change. Therefore, it can be inferred that the company may address environmental issues as they arise, but there is no clear evidence of a proactive approach to preventing or mitigating these impacts.
