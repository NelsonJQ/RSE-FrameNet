[("evaluationPrevention": "Examiner les probl√®mes sur une base ad hoc")], Answer\_Justification : "The table shows that the company has invested in building acquisitions and renovations, as well as operations and maintenance related to energy efficiency and renewable energy. However, there is no clear indication of specific performance targets or tracking mechanisms for environmental impact mitigation. The description mentions that companies often focus on more easily measurable indicators such as resource allocation or number of trainings, but it does not specify whether this company has done so. Therefore, it can be inferred that the company may be addressing environmental issues on an ad-hoc basis rather than through a systematic evaluation and prevention approach."
