 ["RightsImpactPrevention": TRUE, Answer\_Justification: "The company conducts audits of its Tier 1 suppliers and has implemented follow-up plans for non-compliant suppliers. Some houses within the group have also provided personalized coaching to improve supplier performance. Additionally, some houses use solutions to gather direct feedback from employees of suppliers regarding working conditions, which can help identify issues such as forced labor or harassment that may not be detected during audits. These anonymous and confidential surveys are conducted through a mobile messaging app. In 2023, 6% of audited suppliers did not meet the group's performance standards, with most non-conformities related to hygiene and safety issues. The company also collaborates with various stakeholders to prevent or mitigate negative impacts on human rights."]]
