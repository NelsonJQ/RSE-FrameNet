Answer_Justification: "The company has established a committee for ethics and sustainable development, with 75% of its members being independent and 50% being women. This committee aims to ensure that the company adheres to ethical business practices and contributes to reducing corruption. However, the taux de participation individuelle des Administrateurs en fonction au 31 d√©cembre 2023 shows that one member's attendance rate was not 100%, which could potentially affect the committee's ability to effectively prevent corruption. Therefore, it is important for all members to prioritize attending these meetings to ensure the company maintains its commitment to fighting corruption."]
