 ["BoardMembersPercentage": 50], Answer\_Justification: 'The criteria 7 and 8 are fulfilled by Sophie Chassat, Clara Gaymard, Marie-Laure Sauty de Chalon, Natacha Valla and Laurent Mignon. There are no significant business relationships between LVMH and the banks where Natacha Valla and Charles de Croisset work. Therefore, they are considered independent. As a result, 50% of the board members fulfill these criteria.'
